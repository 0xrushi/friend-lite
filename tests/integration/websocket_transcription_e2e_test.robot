Documentation    End-to-End WebSocket Streaming Transcription Tests
...
...              This test suite validates the complete transcription data flow
...              that was previously untested, which led to the end_marker bug.
...
...              Critical paths tested:
...              1. Audio → Deepgram WebSocket → Interim results (pub/sub)
...              2. Stream close → end_marker sent → CloseStream message
...              3. Deepgram → Final results → Redis stream transcription:results:{session_id}
...              4. Speech detection job → Reads Redis stream → Creates conversation
...
...              These tests would have caught the missing end_marker bug immediately.

WebSocket Stream Produces Final Transcripts In Redis
    [Documentation]    Verify that closing a stream triggers end_marker,
    ...                CloseStream message to Deepgram, and final results
    ...                are written to Redis stream transcription:results:{session_id}
    ...
    ...                This test directly validates the bug fix:
    ...                - Producer sends end_marker when finalizing session
    ...                - Streaming consumer detects end_marker
    ...                - Consumer sends CloseStream to Deepgram
    ...                - Deepgram returns final results (is_final=True)
    ...                - Final results written to Redis stream

    ...    Redis stream ${stream_name} is empty - no final transcripts received! This means end_marker was not sent or CloseStream failed.

Speech Detection Receives Transcription From Stream
    [Documentation]    Verify speech detection job successfully reads transcripts
    ...                from Redis stream and does NOT fail with "no_speech_detected"
    ...
    ...                This is the exact failure scenario from the bug:
    ...                - Speech detection reads from transcription:results:{session_id}
    ...                - If stream is empty, returns "No transcription received"
    ...                - If stream has data, creates conversation

Stream Close Sends End Marker To Redis Stream
