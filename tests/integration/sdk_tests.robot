*** Test Cases ***
SDK Can Authenticate With Admin Credentials
    [Documentation]    Test SDK login functionality
    [Tags]    permissions

    ${result}=    Run Process    uv    run    python
    ...    ${CURDIR}/../scripts/sdk_test_auth.py
    ...    ${BACKEND_URL}    ${ADMIN_EMAIL}    ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${result.rc}    0    SDK authentication should succeed
    Should Contain    ${result.stdout}    SUCCESS    Should print success message

SDK Can Upload Audio File
    [Documentation]    Test SDK audio upload functionality
    [Tags]    audio-upload	sdk

    ${test_audio}=    Set Variable    ${TEST_AUDIO_DIR}/audio_short.wav
    File Should Exist    ${test_audio}    Test audio file should exist

    ${result}=    Run Process    uv    run    python
    ...    ${CURDIR}/../scripts/sdk_test_upload.py
    ...    ${BACKEND_URL}    ${ADMIN_EMAIL}    ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}    ${test_audio}
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${result.rc}    0    SDK upload should succeed
    Should Contain    ${result.stdout}    STATUS:processing    File should be in processing status

SDK Can Retrieve Conversations
    [Documentation]    Test SDK conversation retrieval
    [Tags]    conversation	sdk

    ${result}=    Run Process    uv    run    python
    ...    ${CURDIR}/../scripts/sdk_test_conversations.py
    ...    ${BACKEND_URL}    ${ADMIN_EMAIL}    ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${result.rc}    0    SDK should retrieve conversations
    Should Contain    ${result.stdout}    COUNT:    Should print conversation count

SDK Upload Respects Backend File Size Limit
    [Documentation]    Verify SDK properly reports backend errors for oversized files
    [Tags]    audio-upload

    # Note: This tests that SDK handles backend rejection gracefully
    # The 30-minute limit is enforced by the backend, not the SDK
    # Full test would require a 30+ minute audio file

    ${result}=    Run Process    uv    run    python
    ...    ${CURDIR}/../scripts/sdk_test_auth.py
    ...    ${BACKEND_URL}    ${ADMIN_EMAIL}    ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${result.rc}    0    SDK should handle backend errors gracefully
